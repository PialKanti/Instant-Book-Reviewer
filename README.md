# Instant-Book-Reviwer
An android application which app which can give real time reviews from internet by simply capturing a bookâ€™s cover.

## Why i develop it
When I am buying book (usually as a gift) I need to go through titles I never heard about. It's quite difficult to decide which one is good. Would be great if I can just take a picture of the cover with my mobile phone and it would instantly show me real time reviews from the readers. Could also show availability in different stores too. 
In case of this problem, <b>Book Judge</b>(Name of the app) can give the review of the scanned book real time from [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/) which is well known site to book lovers.

## Platform
